## Project Workflow
I like your user stories. I would also like to see in a section of your readme some things you had in your icebox. Additionally it would be cool to see what you struggled with/learned

## Technical Requirements
Really great MVP. I think the site is pretty fluid and intuitive. This project defintely demonstrates you learned a thing or two in the last two weeks!

## Creativity
I really like that hover effect you added to the buttons! I was wondering why the prompt button is much bigger than the other two buttons...

## Code Quality
I really like the comments that you had in your code; however, i would love to see more than just the titles of things. It'd be really nice to describe some functionality like you did in the fisher yates shuffle comments

## Problem Solving
I think you did an awesome job with this project! I really like this project prompt because it displays a clear understanding of problem solving in conjunction with DOM manipulation.

## Total
1- meets expectations. I think you did a great job with this project! You've clearly learned alot in the last two weeks and I'm really happy with the results!
